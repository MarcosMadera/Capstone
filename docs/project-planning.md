This is the idea for my Capstone project.  It is supposed to be the same as Week 4 Homework as I did it there so as not to have to create it twice.
My idea is to get more people interested in South America.  No one I know speaks about South America, just Europe, Africa, China, Australia, Russia, Asia, India but never South America, which I find incredibly sad as the people and the history there is incredible.  The countries are stunningly beautiful.  I didn't want to keep all that to myself but it that has to be then OK, all for me!!
For this cohort I am going to use the entire world to help people look for information that would interest them on countries they find themselves curious about.  From there maybe they will actually find South America on the map and look at it!  One can always Hope!
